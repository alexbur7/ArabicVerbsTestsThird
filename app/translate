Present-future time in arabic specifies an unfinished action which is being performed
at the current moment or it is being started with speech simultaneously

Future time specifies in arabic specifies to an action which will be started in the future. In contrast with Present-future time, a future action is independent of the present events.
This is accomplished due to adding the 'сауфа' (or its brief variant 'син') to begin of the verb of present-future time

In active mode of present-future time and imperative mode a vocalization of a middle letter of a root changes depending on a conjugation word.
(As a rule, in dictionaries this symbol is indicated in quotes next to the word)

Words which have symbols (a, i) in imperative mode in second person vocalize 'alif' with 'kyasra' in the beginning of the word
